limitations  
- only max 2 word verbs  
- each entry corresponds to an estimated 0.33 KB (12 entries = 4 KB)  
    assuming each entry is 0.5 KB:  
    1 KB = 2 entries  
    1 MB = 1024 KB  
    json reading slowdown expected when size reaches +10 MB  
    10 MB = 10240 KB  
    10240 KB = 20480 entries  
      
    an estimated 20000 entries can be made for each list before slowdown is experienced
